# PornHub Video AutoFocus

For some misunderstanding, PornHub does not automatically add focus to the video player when loading a page with a video. Because of this, you can't immediately use hotkeys like "Space" to play/pause, "F" to switch to full screen mode, "←"/"→" to rewind, "↑"/"↓" to change the volume. This requires you to click on the video itself first each time. This userscript solves this problem, videos automatically get focus and hotkeys are available immediately.

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension (or a similar userscript manager) if you haven't already.
2. Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gugglegum/pornhub-video-autofocus/master/pornhub-video-autofocus.user.js) to install the script.

## Usage

The script will automatically focus video player on page load.
